GOODNESS! The one-year anniversary of KONPEITO. I started this project to
provide some content for/to draw attention to the fledgeling Gemini protocol.
In the year since, interest in Gemini has skyrocketted & it has evolved from
 new-Gopher to what people are calling the next big thing & the ethical Web.
           It really makes me proud to have been an early settler.

As Gemini grows & evolves, so should KONPEITO. I decided to tweak the format;
rather than field recording style ambient layer, side B will now exclusively
   be the tape hiss & motor noise of my Sony Walkman, this way even people
without a cassette player can enjoy KONPEITO as it was meant to be heard.

           Sincerely, thank you to you know who for you know what.
